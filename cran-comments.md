## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.4
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* I was requested to change \dontrun{} to \donttest{} for examples, this has lead to 4 examples with extended runtimes.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
